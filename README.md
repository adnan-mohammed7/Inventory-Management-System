## 🌍 Solving a Real-World Problem
Inventory mismanagement leads to significant financial losses across industries. This system provides **a structured way to manage stock**, reducing human errors, enhancing accuracy, and improving efficiency. Whether for **retail, manufacturing, or logistics**, businesses can adapt this system to their needs, showcasing my ability to build **scalable, real-world applications**.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
This project highlights expertise in:
- **JavaFX & UI Design** – Clean and modern UI using FXML.
- **Database-Driven Applications** – Real-time inventory updates via MySQL.
- **Software Engineering Principles** – OOP design, data validation, and structured exception handling.
- **Performance Optimization** – Efficient search and data retrieval techniques.
- **Scalability & Extensibility** – Designed for easy upgrades (e.g., cloud integration, mobile app extension).

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Java 17+**
- **JavaFX (FXML-based UI)**
- **MySQL (JDBC integration)**
- **CSS for UI Styling**
- **Git & GitHub for Version Control**
- **JUnit for Testing**
