I have used primitive data types for my project as it did not had a huge difference when compared to property types.
If I would have user property types instead of primitive types, it could had helped me in modification of parts and products screen where I can bind the textField with the properties but then I had to have a converter for primitive data types apart from string as text fields only accepts string. Another point properties would have been helpful is when I was setting the column cell value for parts and products table.
